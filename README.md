# GeospaceDataSci
Type-alongs that I used to help myself learn geospatial data science. All credit goes to https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-for-geospatial-analysis/. This page helped me so much when I was just a beginner in data science, new to the world of how to navigate goespace and astronomy.
